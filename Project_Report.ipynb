        "### **2.1 Introduction**\n",
        "The **Pet Adoption and Rescue Management System** is designed to streamline and manage the adoption and rescue process of pets. The system ensures structured storage of pet, adopter, rescuer, and foster home details while automating key processes such as adoption tracking, occupancy management, and medical records maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2.2 Problem Statement**\n",
        "Traditional pet adoption and rescue processes suffer from **inefficient record management, difficulty in tracking pet history, and lack of automation**. Manual data handling leads to errors, misplaced records, and delays in adoption procedures. This project addresses these challenges by developing a structured **database-driven solution** that ensures efficiency, integrity, and automation in the pet adoption workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2.3 Objectives**\n",
        "- Design and implement a **structured database schema** for efficient pet adoption and rescue tracking.\n",
        "- Develop an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to map database relationships clearly.\n",
        "- Implement **CRUD operations, triggers, and data retrieval scripts** for automation and integrity enforcement.\n",
        "- Perform **data normalization** to optimize database efficiency and avoid redundancy.\n",
        "- Enforce **constraints and foreign keys** to maintain data consistency.\n",
        "- Conduct **stress testing** to evaluate system performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2.4 Scope of the Project**\n",
        "The system includes:\n",
        "- **Pet Registration & Adoption Management**\n",
        "- **Foster Home & Occupancy Tracking**\n",
        "- **Medical Records Maintenance**\n",
        "- **Triggers & Automation for Data Consistency**\n",
        "- **Normalization & Constraints Implementation**\n",
        "- **Performance Testing & Query Optimization**\n",
        "- **Customer Feedback Management & Delivery Tracking**\n",
